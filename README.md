# Mines Finder

Mines Finder is a Java-based desktop game developed for a Software Engineering class. The objective of the game is to find all the mines hidden in a grid of cells. The game is won when all the cells except for the ones containing mines have been uncovered.

## How to Play

To play Mines Finder, follow these steps:

1. Launch the game by running the `MinesFinder.java` file.
